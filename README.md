Horiseon Website

Description Refactoring Horiseon website to optimise for search engines and enhance accessibility.

The motivation behind creating Horiseon was to bridge the knowledge gap of online marketing. With the increasing importance of digital footprints and online reputations, there is a clear need for a reliable, comprehensive platform that could guide businesses and individuals alike. Through Horiseon, we hope to alleviate the stress of navigating the digital world and provide actionable insights and tools.

Our project stands out because of its user-friendly interface, clarity in information dissemination, and the expertise behind every service offering.
